for building i want it to be basic and easy to learn but hard to master, and i want physics
and weight to be taken into consideration when building bases, i believe we could do something
between teardown's planks with maybe pillars and higher grades of building material like metal
sheets.
or if thats too hard on performance either fake the physics or optimise it heavily to only
work when, for example only 1 side of a plank/sheet is in contact (though this will ruin some
parts of the destruction physics)
to add onto all of this i think we could do something like poly bridge's stress and breaking
system.
while i believe this idea will make our game a lot more unique i believe it will also think
it may make the game harder to run (main goal is to make the game run well) or just too hard
to build bases.

there is option 2 and three though

option 2:
the forest/sons of the forest style building but with more customisation options if that makes sense.

option 3:
boring ahh rust/unturned/7 days to die ahh building, i believe this is overdone and rly boring,
and why i decided to write this doc in the first place
