for each weapon, make it low poly but high detail (example provided in this same directory)
try to rig each model and its parts.
idk how i will figure out the animations if the weapons are completely modular, for more
info call me.
thats about it, put models in their respected folders too.

THE EXAMPLE MODEL IS NOT FORMATTED/SPLIT UP, DO NOT DO THAT.
THERE IS AN EXAMPLE FOR CORRECT FORMATTING IN THE MPX FOLDER.
